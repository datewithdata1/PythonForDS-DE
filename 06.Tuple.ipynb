    "\n",
    "In Python, a tuple is a collection of ordered and immutable elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified once created. This notebook provides an overview of tuples in Python, including their creation, accessing elements, methods, and differences compared to lists.\n",

    "### 1. Creating Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a tuple in Python by enclosing comma-separated elements within parentheses `()`.\n",

    "### Explanation of Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "The immutability of tuples is enforced by the Python interpreter. When you attempt to modify a tuple (e.g., by assigning a new value to an element), Python raises a `TypeError` indicating that tuples do not support item assignment. This behavior ensures that once a tuple is created, its elements remain fixed, providing data consistency and safety.\n",

    "Tuples are useful for representing fixed collections of items that should not be modified. They offer performance benefits over lists in certain scenarios and are a valuable addition to Python's data structures.\n"
